###Financial Research With Brian Granger
#####_initial work accomplished in the summer of 2014_
Contains work which is adding to the development of the Ipython Notebook through research and
development for a library in data and market analysis that has potential applications in
investment management. I am specifically attempting to replicate a model presented by Didier
Sornette which seeks to anticipate big changes or predict crises in the financial market.
He gave a presentation describing his work in a [2013 TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/didier_sornette_how_we_can_predict_the_next_financial_crisis#t-0).
